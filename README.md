# Kitchen::OCI

A Test Kitchen Driver for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

## Prerequisites

You need an ssh keypair defined for your current user.  By default the driver
expects to find the public key in ~/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub, but this can be
overridden in .kitchen.yml.

You need to create suitable configuration for OCI in ~/.oci/config and this
can be created using the CLI:
```bash
oci setup config
```

Ensure that you have a suitable compartment defined, an external subnet, and
security rules that allow incoming SSH and outgoing HTTP to allow Kitchen to
pull the Chef binaries.

## Building the gem

This step is only necessary if you wish to make local modifications.  The gem
has already been published to rubygems.org.

```bash
rake build
```

## Installing the gem

You must install the gem into whatever Ruby is used to run kitchen.  On a
workstation this will likely be the ChefDK environment.  To switch to
ChefDK if you haven't already:

```bash
eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"
```

You can install the gem from RubyGems.org with:

```bash
gem install kitchen-oci
```

To install a gem you built yourself:

```bash
gem install pkg/kitchen-oci-<VERSION>.gem
```

## Example .kitchen.yml

Adjust below template as required.  The following configuration is mandatory for all instance types:

   - `compartment_id`
   - `availability_domain`
   - `shape`
   - `subnet_id`

There is an additional configuration item that allows for toggling instance types.  If this item is not included, it defaults to `compute`.

   - Permitted values of `instance_type`:
      - compute
      - dbaas

Note: The availability domain should be the full AD name including the tenancy specific prefix.  For example: "AaBb:US-ASHBURN-AD-1".  Look in the OCI console to get your tenancy specific string.

### Compute Instance Type

The following configuration is mandatory:

   - `image_id`

These settings are optional:

   - `use_private_ip`, Whether to connect to the instance using a private IP, default is false (public ip)
   - `oci_config_file`, OCI configuration file, by default this is ~/.oci/config
   - `oci_profile_name`, OCI profile to use, default value is "DEFAULT"
   - `oci_config`, Hash of additional `OCI::Config` settings. Allows you to test without an oci config file (see below)
   - `ssh_keypath`, SSH public key, default is ~/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub
   - `post_create_script`, run a script on compute\_instance after deployment
   - `proxy_url`, Connect via the specified proxy URL
   - `user_data`, Add user data scripts
   - `hostname_prefix`, Prefix for the generated hostnames (note that OCI doesn't like underscores)
   - `freeform_tags`, Hash containing tag name(s) and values(s)
   - `use_instance_principals`, Boolean flag indicated whether Instance Principals should be used as credentials (see below)
   - `use_token_auth`, Boolean flag indicating if token authentication should be used (see below)
   - `preemptible_instance`, Boolean flag to indicate if the compute instance should be preemptible, default is `false`.
   - `shape_config`, Hash of shape config parameters required when using Flex shapes.
     - `ocpus`, number of CPUs requested
     - `memory_in_gbs`, the amount of memory requested
     - `baseline_ocpu_utilization`, the minimum CPU utilization, default `BASELINE_1_1`

Optional settings for WinRM support in Windows:

   - `setup_winrm`, Inject Windows powershell to set password and enable WinRM, default false.
   - `winrm_username`, Used to set the WinRM transport username, defaults to 'opc'.
   - `winrm_password`, Set the winrm password.  By default a randomly generated password will be used, so don't set this unless you have to.  Beware that the password must meet the Windows password complexity requirements otherwise the bootstrapping procedure will fail silently and Kitchen will eventually time out.

The `use_private_ip` influences whether the public or private IP will be used by Kitchen to connect to the instance.  If it is set to false (the default) then it will connect to the public IP, otherwise it'll use the private IP.

If the `subnet_id` refers to a subnet configured to disallow public IPs on any attached VNICs, then the VNIC will be created without a public IP and the `use_private_ip` flag will assumed to be true irrespective of the config setting.  On subnets that do allow a public IP a public IP will be allocated to the VNIC, but the `use_private_ip` flag can still be used to override whether the private or public IP will be used.

```yml
---
  driver:
    name: oci
    # These are mandatory
    compartment_id: "ocid1.compartment.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    availability_domain: "XyAb:US-ASHBURN-AD-1"
    image_id: "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    shape: "VM.Standard1.2"
    subnet_id: "ocid1.subnet.oc1.phx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    # These are optional
    use_private_ip: false
    oci_config_file: "~/.oci/config"
    oci_profile_name: "DEFAULT"
    ssh_keypath: "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
    post_create_script: >-
```

### DBaaS Instance Type

The DBaaS instance type configuration should be written in a hash beginning with `dbaas`.

The following configuration item is mandatory for the DBaaS `instance_type`:

   - `db_version`, The specific version of the Oracle database software to be installed. Values can be at either the major version level (eg. 12.1.0.2) or at a PSU level (eg. 12.1.0.2.191015). If no PSU is provided, the latest available will be installed.

The following is a list of optional items for the DBaaS `instance_type`:

   - `cpu_core_count`, CPU core count for DBaaS nodes.  Default value is 2
   - `database_edition`, The edition of the Oracle database software to be installed.  Default value is ENTERPRISE_EDITION
   - `license_model`, The licensing model for the Oracle database software.  Default value is BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE
   - `db_name`, The name of the database to be provisioned.  Must be 8 characters or less, alphanumeric.  Default value is `dbaas1`.
   - `pdb_name`, The name of the pdb to be provisioned.  Only valid if `db_version` is 12cR1 or higher.  Default value is nil (OCI will create a single pdb with the name `db_name`\_PDB1)
   - `admin_password`, The SYS password of the database to be provisioned.  Password must be 9 to 30 characters and contain at least 2 uppercase, 2 lowercase, 2 special, and 2 numeric characters. The special characters must be `_`, `#`, or `-`.  Default value will be a randomly generated password
   - `initial_data_storage_size_in_gb`, The desired amount of database storage in GB.  Default value is 256
   - `character_set`, The characterset of the database.  Default value is AL32UTF8
   - `ncharacter_set`, The national characterset of the database.  Default value is AL16UTF16
   - `db_workload`, The desired workload configuration for the database.  Acceptable values are 'OLTP' and 'DSS'.  Default value is 'OLTP'

Note: At this time, `node_count` is forced to be 1.  RAC provisioning is not supported.

```yml
---
  driver:
    name: oci
    instance_type: dbaas
    ...
    dbaas:
      db_version: "12.1.0.2.191015"
```

## Instance Principals

If you are launching Kitchen from a compute instance running in OCI then you might prefer to use Instance Principals to authenticate to the OCI APIs.  To set this up you can omit the `oci_config_file` and `oci_profile_name` settings and insert `use_instance_principals: true` into your .kitchen.yml instead.

```yml
platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-18.04
    driver:
      ...
      use_instance_principals: true
      ...
```

__Important__: If you want to configure a proxy when using Instance Principals, ensure you define the `no_proxy` environment variable so that all link-local access bypasses the proxy.  For example:

```sh
export no_proxy=169.254.0.0/16
```

This will allow the OCI lib to retrieve the certificate, key and ca-chain from the metadata service.

## Token Auth

If you are launching Kitchen from system configured for token authentication (by running `oci session authenticate`), you need to set `use_token_auth: true`. This is in addition to the `oci_config_file` and `oci_profile_name` settings.

```yml
platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-18.04
    driver:
      ...
      oci_config_file: "~/.oci/config"
      oci_profile_name: "DEFAULT"
      use_token_auth: true
      ...
```

## Use without OCI config file

If you want to run without running `oci setup config` (such as on a build server) you can specify configuration settings that would be in the `~/.oci/config` file directly in the `kitchen.yml`

For example, to use the [OCI CLI Environment Variables](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/clienvironmentvariables.htm) without a config you could have use kitchen's ERB to read environment variables.

```yml
platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-18.04
    driver:
      ...
      oci_config:
        region: <%= ENV['OCI_CLI_REGION'] %>
        user: <%= ENV['OCI_CLI_USER'] %>
        fingerprint: <%= ENV['OCI_CLI_FINGERPRINT'] %>
        authentication_type: <%= ENV['OCI_CLI_AUTH'] %>
        key_file: <%= ENV['OCI_CLI_KEY_FILE'] %>
        tenancy: <%= ENV['OCI_CLI_TENANCY'] %>
      ...
```


## Support for user data scripts and cloud-init

The driver has support for adding user data that can be executed as scripts by cloud-init.  These can either be specified inline or by referencing a file.  Examples:

```yml
  user_data:
    - type: x-shellscript
      inline: |
        #!/bin/bash
        touch /tmp/foo.txt
      filename: init.sh
    - type: x-shellscript
      path: myscript.sh
      filename: myscript.sh
```

The `filename` parameter must be specified for each entry, and determines the destination filename for the script.  If the user data is to be read from a file then the `path` parameter should be specified to indicate where the file is to be read from.

The scripts will be encoded into a gzipped, base64 encoded multipart mime message and added as user data when launching the instance.

Alternately, if you simply pass a string to the user_data, it will be base64 encoded and add as user data when launching the instance.

```yml
  user_data: |
    login: user1
    uid: 1000
    gid: 1000
```

## Proxy support

If running Kitchen on a private subnet with no public IPs permitted, it may be necessary to connect to the OCI API via a web proxy.  The proxy URL can either be specified on the command line:
```bash
# With authentication
export http_proxy=http://<proxy_user>:<proxy_password>@<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>"
# Without authentication
export http_proxy=http://<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>"
```
.. or if preferred in the cookbook's .kitchen.yml file.
```yml
driver:
  ...
  proxy_url: "http://<proxy_user>:<proxy_password>@<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>"
```

The SSH transport can also be tunneled via the web proxy using the CONNECT http method, but note that this is not handled by the kitchen-oci gem.  Configuration is provided here for convenience only:

```yml
transport:
  username: "<os_username>"
  ssh_http_proxy: "<proxy_host>"
  ssh_http_proxy_port: <proxy_port>
  ssh_http_proxy_user: <proxy_user>
  ssh_http_proxy_password: <proxy_password>
```

See also the section above on Instance Principals if you plan to use a proxy in conjunction with a proxy.  The proxy needs to be avoided when accessing the metadata address.

## Preemptible Instances

This will allow you to create a [preemptible instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/preemptible.htm).  Preemptible instances behave the same as regular compute instances, but the capacity is reclaimed when it's needed elsewhere, and the instances are terminated. If your workloads are fault-tolerant and can withstand interruptions, then preemptible instances can reduce your costs.

```yml
---
driver:
  name: oci
  ...
  preemptible_instance: true
  ...
```

## Flex Shape Instances

This will allow you to launch a flexible shape instance.  A flexible shape lets you customize the number of CPUs and memory available when launching or resizing the VM.  Note that there are smaller number of shapes available and the image ocid must also be compatible.  Please consult [OCI documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#flexible) to ensure the proper combination of shape and image ocid.

```yml
---
driver:
  name: oci
  ...
  shape_config:
    ocpus: 2
    memory_in_gbs: 8
    baseline_ocpu_utilization: BASELINE_1_1
  ...
```

## Windows Support

When launching Oracle provided Windows images, it may be helpful to allow kitchen-oci to inject powershell to configure WinRM and to set a randomized password that does not need to be changed on first login.  If the `setup_winrm` parameter is set to true then the following steps will happen:

  - A random password will be generated and stored into the Kitchen state
  - A powershell script will be generated which sets the password for whatever username is defined in the transport section.
  - The script, along with any other user data, will be added to the user data and passed to the new instance.
  - The random password will be injected into the WinRM transport.

Make sure that the transport name is set to `winrm` and that the os\_type in the driver is set to `windows`.  See the following example.

Full example (.kitchen.yml):

```yml
---
driver:
  name: oci

provisioner:
  name: chef_zero
  always_update_cookbooks: true

verifier:
  name: inspec

platforms:
  - name: windows
    os_type: windows

      # These are optional
      use_private_ip: false
      oci_config_file: ~/.oci/config
      oci_profile_name: DEFAULT
      ssh_keypath: "/home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
